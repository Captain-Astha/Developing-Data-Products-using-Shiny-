## R Markdown
This app primarily serves as a capstone project for the Coursera course, "Developing Data Products." Additionally, it provides a basic tool for generating pseudo-random numbers.

To use it, start by entering or sliding to choose the number of random values you want (between 0 and 1337). Then, use the next two sliders to set the minimum and maximum values for the x and y axes, defining the range within which the initial random values will be sampled.

Once everything is set, simply click the "Press Please" button to generate the numbers.
